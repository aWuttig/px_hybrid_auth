# px_hybrid_auth 1.1.0
The HybridAuth extension (px_hybrid_auth) is used to authenticate frontend users against a social provider (e.g. Facebook, LinkedIn) mostly via OAuth. 

It uses HybridAuth (http://hybridauth.sourceforge.net/) as an abstract api to social apis and identities providers such as Facebook, Twitter, MySpace and Google.
